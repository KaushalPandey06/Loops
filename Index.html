        <p>a loop is a control structure that allows a certain block of code to be executed repeatedly, either a specific number of times or until a particular condition is met. Loops help in automating repetitive tasks and are fundamental for efficient and concise program design. There are three loops available in C-language.</p>

        <p>a while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. </p>

                <li>do-while loops are suitable for that programs in which a specific code is need to run and then depends upon the user to proceed further or not. This is done by set a condition to ask for user's opinion. </li><br>

        <h3 id="for">for loop</h3>
        <p>A for loop is a control flow statement in many programming languages, including C. It provides a concise way to write a loop that repeats a specific block of code for a predetermined number of times. The basic syntax of a for loop includes three components: initialization, condition, and update. These components work together to control the loop's execution.</p>
